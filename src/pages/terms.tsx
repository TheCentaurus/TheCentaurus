                        Centaurus has always exercised judgment in allowing or

                        NSFW content is meant for people who are 18 years and
                        older. We allow the sale of this content, but it is
                        subject to being marked NSFW and handled differently
                        than non-NSFW content in navigation menus and search

                        profanity or overtly sexual content are prohibited on
                        Centaurus and will be removed. A smart contract that

                        suggestive manner. Do not use profanity or graphic

                        Centaurus, but we're going to do our best to keep it out
                        of the high traffic areas and if it's extreme in any
                        way, we'll probably remove it.
